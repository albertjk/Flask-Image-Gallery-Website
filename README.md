# Flask image gallery website

## Description

This program was created in October 2017 as part of my university coursework.

This is a web application for a small, random image gallery that uses Flask and Bootstrap.
The home page (route '/') displays three randomly selected images from the 10 provided with the code.
There is also image information code supplied.

Each time the page is refreshed, 3 new images, from the group of 10, are displayed. With randomness, there can be repeats.

Here is an example: 

![Example1](https://github.com/albertjk/Flask-Image-Gallery-Website/blob/master/example1.png)

When an image or the title of an image is clicked, Flask routes to '/picture/...', where ... is the image id.
On the new page the user will see the following:
- image title and author
- the image
- the mode of the image, format, width and height
- a link generated by Flask back to the home page

Here is an example:
