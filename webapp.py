# Author: Albert Jozsa-Kiraly
# The code generates 3 random numbers which correspond to 3 random images, and
# gets the id, title, and author of each of the 3 images from the image_info
# dictionary. There is a route to the home page where these 3 images and their
# titles are displayed. Additionally, there are 3 other routes to each of the
# 3 images, so when the user clicks on an image title or the image itself,
# they are redirected to a new page displaying the full image with some
# additional information. When the home page is refreshed, 3 new random
# pictures and their titles are displayed.

# The provided image information
